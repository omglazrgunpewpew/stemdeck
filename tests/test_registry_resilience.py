"""Two ways the registry used to strand state (#520).

A cancel that lands in the window between the queue worker popping a job and
claiming it left the job at "queued" forever, invisible but still counted
against the capacity limit. And a registry.json that was valid JSON but not an
object stopped the backend booting at all.
